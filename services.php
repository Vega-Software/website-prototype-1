                       Vega Software offers IT strategy studies including needs assessment and definition of a corresponding IT strategy for the client. 
                       This will typically include development of strategies within e.g. systems, workflow, hardware, software, network, integration between 
                       systems, security, back up, virus protection and training.An integral part of any IT implementation is an analysis and design phase. 
                       This phase typically includes description, evaluation and optimisation of procedures. It is vital to acquire an understanding of the 
                       organisation and workflow to be supported by the IT system.

                       <strong>Project Management</strong><br>
                        System implementation projects involve time and personnel resources which require planning and management to ensure optimal 
                        solution within the specified budget and timeline. We adopt the Microsoft Sure Step methodology of project management to ensure the success of our projects.<br>
                        <strong>Business Process & Workflow Analysis</strong><br>
                        We develop solutions for client operation management to ensure efficient business processes that result in overall optimal performance. 
                        Workflow analysis helps ensure smooth transfer of activities through different stages in the work structure eliminating bottlenecks and 
                        enhancing productivity.<br>
                        <strong>Diagnostic Analysis of Critical Applications</strong><br>
                        During implementation, upgrade or enhancement engagements we offer diagnostic analysis services to evaluate the critical details of procedure 
                        to be managed through the application system. This ensures that all client needs are captured and the solution meets them.<br>
                        <strong>Data Analysis</strong><br>
                        Data integrity and control of access is crucial in ensuring that a database contains relevant and quality data. This is done by evaluating the 
                        data requirements, data type and data processes of an organization.<br>
                        <strong>Customization Specification & Testing</strong><br>
                        User requirement often vary from the standard system offering hence we develop the customization requirement specification identifying the interface 
                        with the system processes. Customizations are tested to ensure they meet the objectives of the business process.<br>
                        <strong>Development Specification & Testing</strong><br>
                        System enhancements require developer coding to add new features and processes. We develop specification for development to capture all changes with 
                        documentation for future reference of all code changes. Developer solutions are tested to ensure optimal solution for the specified requirements

                      <strong>Customer specific development</strong><br>
                      Specific solutions that need to address their unique business requirements as required by the users. They are tailored towards the needs of the customer. 
                      These could include the various customizations to be done to meet the intended needs. Customer specific development often involves designing applications 
                      according to the customer requirements.<br>
                      <strong>Creation of complex reports</strong><br>
                      A report is used to present data that contains summary information. E.g. a report to print a list of customers. Creating of different kinds of reports 
                      from available data in the format that can be presented for easy analysis of information. Complex reports involve querying data as required. Reports 
                      present data that could otherwise be difficult to interpret. Ms. Nav has its own application object for designing reports.<br>
                      <strong>Upgrade to customer specific Navision</strong><br>
                      This involves implementing newer version of software you currently use of a more fully-featured version of the current software that may have not been 
                      previously available. There is usually a cost for a software upgrade.<br>
                      <strong>Integrating into office products</strong><br>
                      Application integration is the process of bringing data or a function from one application program together with that of another application program. 
                      The office products already exist and thus the process is sometimes realized by using middleware (an application that mediate between two separate and 
                      often the other is already an existing program), often as Dynamics Nav is written on a custom basis. e.g. Ms. Office Outlook with Ms. Dynamics NAV.<br>
                      <strong>Integrating into other applications</strong><br>
                      Ms. Dynamics Nav can also be integrated with other applications that already exist to meet the various needs of different users. An example is the 
                      database application which will provide the necessary data storage base. Ms. Dynamics Nav can access data stored in the database e.g. SQL server.
