              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Approach</a></h4>
              <p class="description"> Vega Software focuses on creating IT systems in close collaboration with our clients in order to achieve a solution reflecting 
                their specific requirements, needs and wishes.This involves close interaction with the clients and presentation of different versions of the system(s) 
                with increasing functionality, i.e. using a prototyping approach. This approach has the advantage of giving the client the highest possible influence 
                on the final product.Software is our speciality but - to optimise customer service and satisfaction - we also believe in a one stop-shop approach, 
                integrating a range of products and services and can, for instance, also provide state-of-the-art hardware solutions via our network of partners. </p>
